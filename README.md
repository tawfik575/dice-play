# Dice Play

The Dice Play is a web-based game developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that brings the excitement of rolling dice to the screen. It is a simple and interactive game where two virtual players compete against each other to see who can roll the highest points. In the game, a user click a play button to initiate a round. Two dice are rolled for each virtual player, generating random numbers. The points of the players are then compared, and the player with the higher points wins the round.
